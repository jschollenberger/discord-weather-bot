SNJ Mesh Weather Bot v2.7.5
Changes from v2.7.4:
- NEW: --data-dir / --config command-line flags (env: SNJ_BOT_DIR,
  SNJ_BOT_CONFIG) so a single checkout can run several instances, each with
  its own config.json, state.json and log in a separate directory.
- NEW: radar station is configurable (radar_station / radar_station_name /
  radar_region) instead of being hardcoded to KDIX.
- NEW: /radar attaches the live NWS RIDGE loop image instead of only linking
  to it.  The image is fetched and uploaded rather than hotlinked, because
  Discord's CDN caches embed image URLs and would serve a stale frame.
  Falls back to link-only if the fetch fails.  Disable with
  radar_attach_image: false.
- /status now shows the configured coverage and radar station, and puts
  location_name in the title, so multiple instances are distinguishable.

SNJ Mesh Weather Bot v2.7.4
Changes from v2.7.3:
- SECURITY: credentials could be written to weather-bot.log in the clear.
  aiohttp includes the full request URL in its exception text, and the
  Aeris and AirNow endpoints carry credentials in the query string, so any
  HTTP error from those services logged client_secret / API_KEY verbatim.
  A logging filter now redacts all known secrets from every log record.
- FIX: on_ready is re-dispatched by discord.py whenever a session cannot be
  RESUMED, which started a SECOND scheduler — double-posting every
  conditions update and every alert.  One-time setup now runs exactly once,
  while channel resolution stays retryable so a reconnect can recover a
  startup that failed to resolve the channel.
- FIX: an unrecognised alert_post_threshold (e.g. "Warning", "warnings")
  silently fell back to "all", quietly posting every advisory.  Now a
  startup error.
- FIX: alert_suppress_types given as a bare string became a set of single
  CHARACTERS and silently matched nothing.  Now a startup error.
- FIX: malformed or non-object config.json raised a raw JSONDecodeError
  traceback; now reports the line and column of the syntax error.
- FIX: an invalid bot token, missing intents, Discord outage, or network
  failure at startup raised a raw traceback; each now exits with an
  actionable message, with the full traceback written to the log.
- NEW: config warnings for skippable settings (no channel id, no guild id,
  no AirNow key, no coverage block) — reported at startup without blocking.
- NEW: channel resolution retries with backoff instead of leaving the bot
  permanently idle after one transient failure at startup.

SNJ Mesh Weather Bot v2.7.3
Changes from v2.7.2:
- NEW: coverage area is now configurable via the "coverage" key in
  config.json, so one codebase can serve multiple guilds with different
  scopes (e.g. all of Southern NJ vs. Atlantic County only) without
  forking.  Omitting the key keeps the previous 7-county behavior.
- The zone list, county-code list, county-name list and zone->county table
  are now all DERIVED from that single mapping, so they cannot drift apart.
  (The hand-maintained zone->county table was wrong for 9 of 10 zones in
  v2.7.)
- Coverage config is validated at startup: malformed UGC codes, zone codes
  used where county codes belong (and vice versa), and empty coverage are
  reported as normal config errors instead of silently matching nothing.
- Region-specific display strings now follow location_name / coverage
  rather than being hardcoded to "Southern NJ" and the 7-county list.
- Renamed for region-neutrality: _affects_southern_nj -> _in_coverage,
  _snj_area_str -> _coverage_area_str, _is_snj_zone -> _is_coverage_zone,
  _SNJ_* -> _COVERAGE_*, _NJZ_COUNTY_FALLBACK -> _ZONE_TO_COUNTY.

Changes from v2.7.1:
- FIX: _find_ref_in_posted() matched the first reference found in an update's
  `references` list, not necessarily the immediate predecessor.  NWS often
  lists the entire update chain (not just the last hop), so on a 2nd+ update
  this could latch onto an older ancestor still in `posted`, misdirecting
  reply-threading and leaving the true immediate predecessor to fall through
  to the natural-expiry clear path instead.  Now matches by most recent `ts`
  among all candidates, independent of list order.

Changes from v2.7.1:
- FIX: alert geography — UGC codes are now matched against explicit,
  verified NWS zone/county sets instead of a numeric 15-27 range.  The old
  range misread county codes (NJC021/023/025 = Mercer/Middlesex/Monmouth)
  and included zones NJZ015/020/026 (Mercer, Ocean, Coastal Ocean), so
  out-of-area alerts were posting.  Ocean County is now excluded.
- FIX: _NJZ_COUNTY_FALLBACK zone->county table was shifted by one zone;
  "Active Alert" link buttons were built with the wrong county for most zones.
- FIX: state.json unbounded growth — superseded and suppressed alert entries
  are now pruned after 48 h (previously only cleared entries were, and
  superseded/suppressed entries never became cleared).
- FIX: an NWS alerts API outage no longer looks like "zero active alerts",
  which could post false CLEARED messages for every live alert.  Fetch
  failures now skip the cycle entirely.
- FIX: _validate_config() now catches non-numeric forecast_lat/lon and the
  interval/threshold/day/hour settings and reports them as a normal config
  error instead of crashing on startup with a raw traceback.
- FIX: exception log lines now include the exception type name, so failures
  whose str() is empty (e.g. a bare TimeoutError) no longer log a blank,
  useless line.
- FIX: ConditionsRefreshView's per-user cooldown dict now sweeps stale
  entries instead of growing for the life of the process.

Changes from v2.6:
- aiohttp replaces requests: all fetches are now native async coroutines;
  asyncio.to_thread() eliminated entirely; a shared ClientSession is reused
  across all calls and closed cleanly on shutdown
- _http_get is async: retries use asyncio.sleep so the event loop is never blocked
- fetch_forecast uses _http_get (was accidentally left using raw requests)
- Atomic state writes: state.json written to .tmp then renamed so a crash
  mid-write never corrupts the file
- Scheduler body wrapped in try/except: an uncaught exception no longer
  silently kills the loop
- Circuit breaker per service: after 5 consecutive failures the service is
  skipped for 30 min; after 10 for 2 h; resets on success
- _fetch_and_build_conditions() helper: single coroutine used by the
  scheduler, /conditions, and the Refresh button — no more three call sites
  to keep in sync
- /status command: uptime, last fetch times, active alerts, AQI category,
  circuit-breaker status — ephemeral, works in DMs
